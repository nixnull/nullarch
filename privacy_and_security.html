    <h2>What and Why</h2>
    People have said it better, but I think restating is always useful.  On this page I'm advocating that you adopt a more mindful use of technology. Specifically, I think everyone should be supportive of secure, private, and FOSS tools. Not every tool I will mention is all of these things, and you may have good reasons to choose something that prioritizes one over the other. But I think all three are excellent ideals.
    <h3>Secure</h3>
    Nobody can access it except who is intended to. This isn't just passwords and codes sent to your phone. This is also end-to-end encryption, which means nobody in the middle can see it. You might trust a company, but if their service isn't end-to-end encrypted, then a government can force them to turn data over, or a hacker can steal it.
    <h3>Private</h3>
    If anyone can or does know, they're not sharing that information. Most free, company-owned services are selling your data to make their money. Sometimes this data is later used to try to sell you things. Sometimes to try to campaign to you. Sometimes it's used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221007072431/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/10/facebook-user-data-abortion-nebraska-police">arrest you for breaking oppressive laws.</a>
    <h3>FOSS</h3>
    Free Open Source Software. Free as in, no strings attached. Open Source meaning that anyone can see the code, contribute to the code, or make their own version. This software is made by volunteers or donation-ran groups, or sometimes funded by companies but released freely anyway. Firefox and Linux are FOSS. Most of Android and Chrome is (some of it is owned by Google). Apache, MySQL, and WordPress (which run a huge portion of the internet) are all FOSS. Nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Supercomputers">every super computer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Public_servers_on_the_Internet">every website</a> runs on FOSS software.
    </br></br>
    The important thing here is that FOSS means no profit motive, and the project can continue even beyond the original creators. Because there's not profit motive, it tends to not have antifeatures like ads and data tracking, and over time tends to become more featureful and useful to the end users.

    <h2>My List</h2>
    A lot of lists try to give you several options that are the best by their standards. I don't know if my things are the best. But they are what I actually use daily, which I think might be more important.
    <ul>
        <li>Signal</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Ublock Origin</li>
            <li>Decentraleyes</li>
            <li>Clear URLs</li>
