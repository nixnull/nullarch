        <p>The current game is OpenTTD. It is an old school "business simulation game" but I'd describe it more as a transport logistics game. It's a free open-source continuation of the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe that adds many modern improvements as well as a robust mod management system.</p>
        
        <p>The Game's Club is invite-only. If you're not already there, ask someone who is.<p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>OpenTTD is free and available for pretty much any platform you'd play games on. It should run on nearly anything. You can find it on <a href="https://www.openttd.org/">the official website</a>, Steam, GOG, and probably a bunch of other places. We're playing on the newest version, which is <em>13.0-beta1</em>. If you got the game from Steam, switch to the "Testing" beta. As far as the mods used on the server, there's nothing you need to do! The game will automatically load mods and apply the settings the server asks for.</p>
        
        <p>Here's some resources for learning the game:</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZyh2v9Z0w">An excellent tutorial</a> that even taught me a couple things.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/">The wiki manual</a>, which I still use regularly.</p>

        <h2>Mods/Tweaks on the Server</h2>
        
        <p>Since I know many players are newer, we will be playing a vanilla+ game. This means that the above tutorials should be mostly correct. The important settings that we are tweaking, and their effects, are as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Cargodist - This is probably the most impactful one, though I think the change is fairly intuitive. Basically, mail and passengers will have specific destinations. In the base game, they can be sent anywhere. This just encourages more realistic passenger transport. For more details look <a href="https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Passenger%20and%20cargo%20distribution">here</a>. I have both set to "symmetric".</li>
            <li>When paused allow all actions - so you can build even if the game is paused.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally we'll be using the following mods:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>OpenGFX+ mods - These are basically just extensions of the base game, adding some more small features and world generation options.</li>
            <li>eGRVTS 2.1, av8, and Squid ate FISH - These all add more vehicles to the game.</li>
            <li>Midwestern City Names - to make it feel more like home</li>
