        <h2 id="mine">What and Why</h2>
        I am a white male (though I use them/them pronouns). I am bisexual. These aren't the first descriptors that come to mind for me normally, but the reality is that they are identity categories I am placed into in systems of power and oppression. We are taught to perform our categories without question, and we are met with privileges, prejudices, and limitations by the society around us based on our identities. In order to disassemble these systems, we have to understand how they effect both ourselves and others.
        
        On the right (or below on small screens) is my very incomplete reading/viewing list for media that will help you understand these systems, the role you've been placed in, how they effect others, and how we can begin to disassemble them. My advice, learned the hard way: start with the materials that disassemble your own identities. You're going to be a terrible ally if you are dealing with denial and guilt.

        <h3>Masculinity</h3>
        Unfortunately, we don't talk about disassembling masculinity often. We talk about how toxic men are, but mostly either angrily or guiltily. There's rarely a discussion on how to perform healthy masculinity, or how every male and otherwise can work to disassemble the masculine side of patriarchy. However, there's still some great discussion.

        <b>The Will to Change</b> by bell hooks. I would consider this the premier text on the topic. Men should read this. Everyone should read this, but especially men.
