        I am a white male (though I use them/them pronouns). I am bisexual. These aren't the first descriptors that come to mind for me normally, but the reality is that they are identity categories I am placed into in systems of power and oppression. We are taught to perform our categories without question, and we are met with privileges, prejudices, and limitations by the society around us based on our identities. In order to disassemble these systems, we have to understand how they effect both ourselves and others.
        </br></br>
        On the right (or below on small screens) is my very incomplete reading/viewing list for media that will help you understand these systems, the role you've been placed in, how they effect others, and how we can begin to disassemble them. My advice, learned the hard way: start with the materials that disassemble your own identities. You're going to be a terrible ally if you are dealing with denial and guilt.

        <h3>Patriarchy, Feminism, and Masculinity</h3>
        </br></br>
        <b>The Will to Change</b> by bell hooks. This book offers an exceptional and empathetic look at how toxic masculinity is taught to and reinforced in men, how it effects them, and how everyone can work together to dismantle toxic masculinity and patriarchy.
        </br></br>
        <b>Fed Up</b> by Gemma Hartley. Hartley breaks down the roles that society expects of women in their relationships. She notes that both women and men are often not consciously aware of the extent of the dynamic between them, and how things could change.
