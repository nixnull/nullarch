        I'm known as nix. I am an educator, a utopian anarchist, and a nerd. I'm trying to be a better advocate for the causes I care about.

        <h2>Things I'm Involved In</h2>
        This website is my attempt to take all the things I think are important (plus some fun things) and put them in one place. Think of it like my showroom or library. I hope you explore and take some things away from it.
