        <p>I'm known as nix. I am an educator and anarchist that believes in a community of mutual aid and support without hierarchy or control. I'm trying to be a better advocate for the causes I care about, and embody the way of living I wish to see in others.</p>
        <h2>Things I'm Involved In</h2>
        <p><a href="https://agoranomic.org/">Agora Nomic</a> - A game/community where I currently run the website, moderate the discord, and track some gameplay stuff as well as often writing proposals for new gameplay.</p>
        <p><a href="30DayFOSSChallenge.html">The 30 Day FOSS Challenge</a> - A challenge I've issued to myself and anyone else that would like to participate asking you to reduce your reliance on proprietary software and technology.</p>
        <p><a href="https://stlurbanist.org/">St. Louis Urbanist</a> - My local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanism">urbanism</a> advocacy group. We push for a better built-environment that is less car dependent and more accessible and equitable for all citizens.</p>
