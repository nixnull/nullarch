The system we have doesn't work. It serves the rich, elite, and powerful. It does not serve the average person, and it certainly does not serve everyone. Anger about this is growing, and the divide between those with different visions of a just world, and different strategies to reach it, is growing. It's a bit of a scary time. 

We have a left and a right, locked in a classic struggle. But we have another classic struggle just within the left (which is also mirrored in the right). We have reformists and revolutionaries. Reformists believe that the current system just needs to be tweaked. If they're a liberal, they believe we just need to beat the conservatives. If they're a progressive they might lean towards some more racial and economic justice, maybe even adopting some socialist policies. But ultimately they think the current system is fundamentally good but flawed. Revolutionaries disagree. These are the people who want an alternative system entirely. Some are communists, some are anarchists. And there's many subdivisions within. They tend to believe that a conflict, usually between classes, is already occuring and will inevitably leave to warfare. They tend to want to prepare for that war through power-building, vanguardism, and armament.

I am an anarchist. I can sympathize with my revolutionary comrades, I see their logic. And anyone who has studied history has seen their strategies even bear fruit in the USSR and China (though many would argue the quality and longevity of these wins).
